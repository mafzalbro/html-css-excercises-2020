<h2>How to learn computer science for beginners?</h2>

<p>Getting started with any field, one has many queries and questions.</p> 

<b> If I will able to do computer science or not? </b><br />
<br />
<b> is it right for me as a computer science begginer? </b><br />
<br />
<b> Am I good in doing computer science? </b> 
<br /><br />
<b>Is computer science is easy and interesting for me?</b>
<br /><br />
<p> And many other questions, which we will discuss in this session. </p>

<p> So, let me start from the point about any person which has zero knowledge in the computer science. </p> 

<p><b> What if he or she will join the computer science and proceed it to become computer expert? </b> </p>

<p> The person is abviously able and even if he does not know about meaning of computer. Dear, Computer is very interesting and enjoyable field for all. On the side, the <b>Computer Science</b> has become need of every department of life and <b> all mathematics problems can be easily solved.</b> </p>


<p> The <b>programming </b> has become very effective and productive. Todays <b>program</b> is very different than older time’s programming. The new coming and <b>available languages</b> have become easier than that had came 5 to 10 years ago like <b> java, php and phython.</b> </p>


<p> You can join the computer science as a career in that time. If you have interest, in this then it is <b>not difficult.</b> </p>

<p> That was all stuff, which is in your mind before starting and getting the knowledge about computer science. </p>
  
<h2>Is the computer science programming only?</h2>
 
<p> <b> No, </b>  the computer science is not only the bundle of programs and also it is <b>not only theory</b> whereas it is set of both. Here we learn programming which is very <b>important tool of computer.</b> </p>

<p>  We study many and diversified topics like graphics, managment, problem solving and many others. These are assets of computer science that will really beneficial for you. </p>

<p> This is very important for you to know about computer science before getting start learning about it. You need to read out completely till the end. </p>

<h2> Graphics </h2>

<p> One of the <b>greatest field</b> in the <b>Computer science is Graphics,</b> which is broad and seperately known all around. For that you need to know about <b>Graph Theory</b>. </p> 

<h2> Programming </h2>

<h3>How do we write code? </h3>
 
<p> In the <b>Programming,</b> the Programmer not always do Programming all the day and he does not sit before the Screen. </p>

<p> The programming do many kinds of task. He do paper work, make logics and design the complete information in better form.</p> 

<p> In the programming, you don’t need only to learn about how to write the program in any programming language. You need also to learn how to write algorithm and problem solving techniques. </p>

<p> You need to develop your logic building skills. You need to work on the paper to give model to any program you are writing. The <b>Games, Applications and Softwares</b> are run better due to better programming skills. </p>

<p> Which are developed on the basis of a <b>organized mindset</b> raised by logic building skills.</p>

<p>So the purpose of talking about organized mindset is that theory is very important as well as practice. <b>Hope you can understand.</b></p>

<p> You see the <b> Facebook, Youtube, Google, Twitter and all Social media websites</b> and you can see windows operating systems. These are all due computer science and specifically programming and <b>having an ideollogy. </b></p>

<p>So, <b>keeping in mind</b> all above things. Our next point is related.</p>

<h2>Research is important!</h2>

<p>If the <b>Proper Research</b> is involved in developing the softwares then better output can be achieved. Any performance in any plateform canbe done attractive and effective.</p>

<p>For example, if you have editing skills, then you can edit the picture but if you have done better research then you can Developed Images. You know better about the difference between a picture (contains objects) and image (reflects thoughts).</p>

<p> <b> Hope you understand, the given example.</b> </p> 

<p>Research gives many ideas, thoughts and plotting the story. You experience others work.</p>

<h2> How to get started in Computer Science? </h2>

<p> Getting started with the computer science is very hard. Its reason is you see already developed programs which are made with the <b>Years of struggle</b> and you could not understand it. As you don’t know the <b> Basics of Programming,</b> you panic and give up at a time. It is very degerous for you. </p>

<p>To get started, you need to clear all the basics about computer science. You need to start from the <b> definition of computing. </b> </p>

<h2> Visit random plateforms </h2>

<p> To learn the basics, the computer science is available on different plateforms specially online.</p>

<p> You can install mobile apps, Documents in pdf or docx form, Softwares and Online websites.</p>

<p> Online website content, of trusted plateforms, are best source of learning. There are many sites like khan academy are very intersting and betterly represents content than <b>ordinary books.</b></p> 

<h2> Join student organizations </h2>

<p>The students and classmates are better options to learn computer science. According to my personal experience, when you talks about a particular problem with others you have gripped better on that topic for a long term.</p>

<p>So, that will better option for you. If you like <b>Community and group work,</b> you can work on that idea.</p>

<h2> Make friendships with seniors and old stundents of CS </h2>

<p>Mostly students feel fear to talk with teachers. And they could not ask openly. Due to this fear, they always miss the important points and queries. They missed that thing, in most cases, which was most important. </p>

<p> The better solution is make you friendship with the seniors and get some instructions and guidlines for plan your goals. </p>

<h2> Work on your Small projects </h2>

<p> You have to do some creatives and productive activities during the process of learning the computer science. Make some proper projects. </p>

<p>For example, if you are doing programming, you can do basic projects to calculate something i.e. income calculator and simple box generator. </p>

<p> These projects will make you more expert on these CS skills that you are learning.</p> 

<p> Do some tasks ralated to Computer Science Practice is more efficient in every field. </p>

<p> Computer Science is also a field of practical. You need to do tasks and activities of computer science. You need to see the researchs and journals of computer scientists to get the ideas.</p>

<h2> Keep your mind fresh </h2>

<p> Your mind is powerful computer. It needs rest to work properly, so you have to focus on the mind to make it stuffless and fresh. </p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

<p>The many other important things. But it is sufficient to get started for beginners. I have discuss here the points that a beginner should know about it. </p>
